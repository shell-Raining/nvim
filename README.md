## Introduction

Based on the configuration of the `Nvim 0.8.1` version, it aims to make an out-of-the-box and full-featured code editor.

advantage:

- Fast boot (60ms to complete the boot, the test environment is i5-12500H + 16G DDR5)
- Customizability (completely transparent configuration, build your own IDE in your own way)
- Extensibility (customization via various community-driven plugins with many pre-made features)

## Use

Open the [settings.lua](./lua/core/setting.lua) file to adjust Nvim's configuration functions.

Open the [options.lua](./lua/core/options.lua) file and set your personal preferences.

Open the [mapping.lua](./lua/core/mapping.lua) file to set the base keys.

Open the [lua/utils/public/icons.lua](./lua/utils/public/icons.lua) file to change the icons to your liking.

Open the [mason.lua](./lua/config/basic/mason.lua) file and add the `LSP`, `DAP`, `Linter`, `Formatter` and other external tools you need .

If you want to customize the startup configuration of a certain `LSP`, you should configure it in [lua/config/lsp/server_configurations](./lua/config/lsp/server_configurations) directory.

If you want to customize the startup configuration of a `DAP`, you should do this in [lua/config/dap/dap_configurations](./lua/config/dap/dap_configurations) directory to create configuration files.

You can change anything you don't like, and if you don't know how to change it, you can file an ISSUE.
